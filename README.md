Explanation on how the Sentiment & Emotion Analyzer Works
Afternoon guys
 
Here's the written documentation of how our Sentiment Analyzer Works:
 
How the Sentiment & Emotion Analyzer Code Works
Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the Streamlit app, broken into logical sections. Each section explains its purpose and how it contributes to the overall functionality.
1. Imports and Emoji Map
This section brings in the core libraries and defines a dictionary mapping emotion labels to emoji characters.
import streamlit as st   Enables Streamlit’s API for building the UI and handling session state.
import pandas as pd   Provides data structures and I/O for CSV/XLSX upload, download, and display.
EMOJI_MAP   A Python dict where keys are emotion names and values are emojis. Used to decorate outputs with friendly icons.
2. Stub Analyzer and Sample Data
Here we define placeholder functions you’ll replace with real NLP logic.
run_sentiment_emotion_analysis(text, model_name)
Inputs: raw text and a model choice (basic/advanced).
Outputs:
sentiment_label (e.g., “positive”)
sentiment_score (float between 0–1)
emotion_label (e.g., “joy”)
emotion_score (float between 0–1)
load_sample_data()
Returns a small DataFrame of example texts for users to download and test batch analysis.
3. Session State Initialization
Streamlit’s st.session_state holds data across reruns (widget interactions trigger a rerun).
Initialize history (list of past analyses).
Initialize emoji_map (copy of EMOJI_MAP) so custom edits persist.
Initialize quick_text (string for the sidebar text area) to allow programmatic clearing.
4. Sidebar: Global Controls
All user inputs and global settings live in the sidebar.
File Upload & Sample Download
st.file_uploader: Accepts CSV/XLSX.
st.download_button: Provides a sample CSV from load_sample_data().
Quick Text Analysis
st.text_area: Free-form text input bound to session_state.quick_text.
st.button("Analyze Now"): Runs stub analysis, appends results to history, and clears the text box.
Settings & Filters
st.slider:
threshold: sentiment cutoff for coloring.
confidence: minimum emotion score to display.
st.selectbox("Select Model"): Chooses between stub “basic”/“advanced.”
Emoji Map Customization
st.expander: Reveals a list of st.text_input widgets, one per emotion key.
Each input updates session_state.emoji_map so new emojis stick across runs.
Theme Preference
st.selectbox("Light or Dark?"): Placeholder; selecting doesn’t auto-change the theme but may inform future CSS logic.
5. Main Area: Tabbed Interface
The UI is split into five tabs for focused workflows.
Home
Welcome message and high-level instructions.
Single Analysis
Displays the most recent entry in history.
Colors sentiment text green/red/orange based on threshold.
Shows emotion label + custom emoji if emotion_score ≥ confidence.
Batch Results
Reads the uploaded file into a DataFrame (df).
Iterates over each row’s “text” column, running analysis and collecting results.
Concatenates original text with new sentiment/emotion columns.
Styles the sentiment_score column (green/red background).
Offers a download of the full results CSV.
Visualizations
Placeholder section. You can insert charts (e.g., bar charts of sentiment distribution or word clouds) here.
History
Presents a table of every analysis run in this session.
Download button to export history as CSV.
“Clear History” button empties the list for a fresh start.

Opening (1–2 min)
“The Sentiment & Emotion Analyzer is a Streamlit web application that lets users analyze text for both sentiment and emotions. It supports single text inputs, bulk file uploads, emoji customization, and history tracking — all in an interactive UI. I’ll walk you through how the code is structured and how each part contributes to the functionality.”
1. Imports & Emoji Map (1–2 min)
We start by importing Streamlit for the UI and handling state, and Pandas for working with CSV or Excel data.
There’s also an emoji map — a simple Python dictionary where each emotion (like joy, anger) maps to an emoji.
This makes results more visual and engaging for the user.
2. Analyzer & Sample Data (2 min)
There’s a stub analyzer function called run_sentiment_emotion_analysis().
It accepts a text string and a model choice (“basic” or “advanced”).
Returns sentiment label + score, and emotion label + score.
Right now it’s a placeholder — in production, we’d replace it with a real NLP model.
We also have a sample data loader so users can download a small dataset and test batch analysis without providing their own file.
3. Session State (1–2 min)
Streamlit apps rerun every time a widget changes — so to persist data, we use st.session_state.
We initialize:
History → a list of past analyses.
Emoji Map → so user’s custom icons stick.
Quick Text → lets us clear the text box after an analysis.
4. Sidebar Controls (3–4 min)
The sidebar acts as the control center:
File Upload & Sample Download → lets users analyze CSV/XLSX files, or download a sample file.
Quick Text Analysis → a text area and “Analyze Now” button for instant, one-off checks.
Settings & Filters:
Sentiment Threshold → changes color coding of results.
Emotion Confidence Filter → hides low-confidence results.
Model Selector → choose between analysis modes.
Emoji Customization → an expandable panel to set your own emojis.
Theme Preference → currently just a placeholder for future dark/light mode.
5. Main Area Tabs (3–4 min)
The main display has five tabs, each with a specific purpose:
Home → welcome message and instructions.
Single Analysis → shows the most recent analysis with color-coded sentiment and emojis.
Batch Results → processes uploaded files line by line, adds results, lets users download as CSV.
Visualizations → placeholder for charts, graphs, and possibly word clouds in the future.
History → a running log of all analyses in the session with options to export or clear it.
6. Footer (30 sec)
Simple HTML footer for credits and branding.
Highlights that the app is AI + Streamlit powered.
